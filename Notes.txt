We tried to fix the links, it didn't work.

1. Continue working on fixing the paths so they don't fill. (FIXED)
2. Discuss layout approach on change. (Discussed)

1. We need to look at the sugyama documentation. We are trying to control the horizontal ordering of the nodes on a layer. Can we 
directly calculate the distance between nodes per layer.
2. Possibly, work on importing private functions from d3-dag library. Need to breakout the sugyama algorithm. Siggie not convinced.

1. We successfuly did git diff
2. Circle sizes are either not being calculated or are not rendering
3. Fix repository branches, origins, mains, and masters.

1. Kind of solved the circle issue.
2. clicked circle not following proper movement pattern.
3. code is in master, not in main. Update default
4. Need to look into functions enter, update, and exit. May have been changed in new D3.
5. Update seems to be doing most of the heavy lifting in terms of calculating initial location and transitions. Not sure why.
6. Update function not applying to on-clicked circle.
